"""This script is for the automatic and repetitive backup of git branches

You need to copy paste this code to a folder outside
the local git repo, then run in terminal python backup.py
Follow the input prompts in the terminal and specify the paths
of git repo and the location of backup.

You still need to specify manually all the branch names in the list:
branchname for all the local git branches you wish to back up.

The directory on your backup disk does not need to be created
separately prior to running this script.
